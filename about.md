In tactile sensing research, I want to understand the working principle of “dark sense” or “muscular sense”, introduced by the physiologist Ivan Sechenov  in the 1860s.

Working with me:

If you want to come and work with me, I expect you to learn SolidWorks for CAD, AltiumDesigner for PCB,   Linux, IDEs  (KDevelop and QTcreator ), or for advanced developers text-based editors (such as Vim or Emacs), Blender, version control systems (e.g., git), LaTex.

I can offer  opportunities for potential MS students  to get into the the EU robotics community. After a rather sad consequence of tragedies, including collapse of USSR, World War II, USSR-Finish War in 1939-1940, famine in 1930s, we lost our supervisors who could advise and teach young generations. My supervisors were PhD holders from all around the World, including Vadim Nikolayevich MISHIN (Tomsk, Russia) – the strongest emotional competence I ever met, Yoshihiro KONISHI-san (Japan and Taiwan) – the toughest person in discipline I ever met, Veronique PERDEREAU (France) – the most wise and  diplomat I ever met. I can not be a “supervisor” for the young generation but still, I am pretending to be a “more experienced coach”. I force students always to have their own opinion and view to the problem. My rule of thumb for a  student is to learn by yourself (it builds neurons that will help in the future life to solve new problems without a supervisor).  I do realize that such approach requires strong nerves to keep working — for which I do not regret nor apologize.

Student internships and master theses:

I welcome Master students, and I’m especially interested in robotics-CS students (Linux, C, CAD, PCB, Mechatronics). I will stimulate them to contribute to Tactile Robotics projects
